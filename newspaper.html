    <center><h1>Steroid Article</h1></center>
    <p>             Legal steroids, also known as steroid alternatives, are compounds formulated by supplement companies to mimic the positive effects of anabolic steroids but without the harsh side effects.

There is a huge demand for anabolic steroids right now; however, not everyone wants to break the law or endure the serious health consequences that come with taking steroids.

In contrast, the ingredients in legal steroids are FDA-approved and deemed safe for human consumption.

Also, legal steroids can be easily bought online without having to get a prescription from a doctor or put your health in a criminal’s hands. This is essentially what happens when people buy steroids illegally via the black market, as you are not buying from a reputable company and thus are not guaranteed to get what is on the label..</p>
